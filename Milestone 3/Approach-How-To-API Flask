Step 2: Design a clickable UI which can automate tasks performed under milestone 2 [ 5 points ]

Step 3: Design a clickable UI based chatbot interface [ 5 points ]

Overview:


User --> Requests --> API Server --> Pickle Model

a) Create an API for the model, using Flask which is a Python micro framework for building web applications.
b) This API will allow us to utilize the predictive capabilities through HTTP requests


Create the Webpage: 

- This is the frontend part. Webpage will have a text box in which a user can type in the Description of Accident and click on "Predict" button to get the result i.e. Accident Severity


Connect the Webpage with the Model

- Here we need to load the saved pickled model
- Define a function 'results', to get the prediction result from the model
- This module
